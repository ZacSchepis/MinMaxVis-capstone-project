## CS 4488 TicTacToe Checkers Min Max Visualization

### Step 1: Implement a TicTacToe game using minmax and alpha beta pruning. Use QT and C++

### Step 2: Implement a detailed visualization of the step-by-step process of the above min max algorithm calculating the next move. The goal is to allow the user to understand the details of the min max algorithm. You will need some sort of visual tree showing the tree representing the various board used to calculate the min max. Provide a step button that is pressed for each step in the min max algorithm with a detailed written explanation of that step and a line to the relevant portion of the min max tree.

### Step 3: Extend the visualization in step 2 to add alpha beta pruning.

### Step 4: Write a checkers game with 2 players.

### Step 5: Use min max with alpha beta pruning to implement the second player in step 4.
