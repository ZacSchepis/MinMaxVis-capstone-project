# Capstone Project
This will contain the various info needed for this course.

# Minimum Team Responsibilities
1.	Plan for your overall enterprise
2.	Analysis of the user, the users’ tasks, the external design, and the internal design.
3.	Feasibility analysis and proposal for each task
4.	Effort estimates – including task decomposition and estimated durations
5.	Project schedule in advance of project implementation
6.	Hardware and software recommendations (if appropriate).
7.	Progress reports.
8.	Final reports including documentation, operating instructions, software, training materials, software repair procedures, procedure documents.
9.	Attendance of each team member to teach meeting during the reporting period including arrival time if >8:00am. (On time is late.)

# External Code Libraries
We cannot use any external code that is not part of the base langauge (include <iostream> is ok in C++) w/o instructor permission. Our goal is to learn to write the code in such a library, not simply use code someone else has written. We must be able to write the code others use.

# Individual and Team Grading
Every three weeks, each team __**producer**__, will submit a short producer report listing the following in 3 seperate sections:
1.	 Producer Report Section 1: Tasks the team was planning on accomplishing (including which team member(s) responsible, which team members worked on the task, estimated number of hours, and start date). 
  a.	The producer report section 1 of planned tasks from Producer Report N should match the last of planned tasks from section 3 of Producer Report (N-1).
2.	Producer Report Section 2: What tasks were actually finished (not worked on but “stake through the heart”) and by whom, with estimated staff hours, actual staff hours, start date, and completion date. (For each task I will need a rank ordered list of those team members who worked on that task)
  a.	The section on what tasks were accomplished needs to include a rank ordering of the relative effort of teach team member during that producer report time period.
  b.	What team meetings (dates and times) occurred during the producer report period (time and duration) and who did and did not attend.
3.	Producer Report Section 3: What tasks the team is planning on accomplishing next including by whom and estimated staff hours and most likely start dates. 

# Thoughts and Questions
Some other thoughts and questions:
1.	If you do all the work yourself, you cannot pass
2.	If you free-ride you cannot pass
3.	Team work is the path to success – if one end of the boat sinks, the entire boat sinks.
4.	Since this course is participatory in nature, no provision is made for missed work.
5.	All work is due no later than the beginning of the final class period (Friday dead week).
6.	Are there ethical considerations you have missed while doing the project?
7.	How would one calculate the payback on a project?
8.	Explain how to calculate the break-even point of a project.
9.	Explain the relationship between top-down design and bottom up testing. 
10.	Could your project be marketed overseas?
11.	Explain structured walk-throughs in detail including participants and outcomes.
12.	What is the time relationship between programming, documentation, design, and testing?
13.	What are the components of a system proposal?
14.	What is the work breakdown structure?
15.	What is the difference between a requirement and a specification?
16.	What is the relationship between the systems analyst and the systems tester?
17.	Could your organization be viable in the ‘real world”?
